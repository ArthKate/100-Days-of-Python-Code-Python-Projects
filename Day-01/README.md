# Band Name Generator

This project is part of the **100 Days of Python Code** challenge. It is a simple Python program that generates a band name based on user input.

## How It Works

The program asks the user two questions:
1. The name of the city they grew up in.
2. The name of their favorite pet.

It then combines these inputs to create a unique band name.

## Features

- Interactive user input.

2. Navigate to the `Day-01` folder.
3. Run the `Band-Name-Generator.py` file using Python:

  python Band-Name-Generator.py
  ```
4. Follow the prompts to generate your band name.

## Example Output

```

What's the name of the city you grew up in? Seattle
What's your pet's name? Luna
Your band name could be: Seattle Luna
```
