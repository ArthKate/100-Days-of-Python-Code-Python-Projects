# Reeborg's World Maze Challenge

This project is a solution to the Reeborg's World Maze Challenge, part of the 100 Days of Python Code challenge.

## Challenge Description

Reeborg needs to navigate through a maze to reach the goal. The maze has walls, and Reeborg must use logic to avoid obstacles and find the correct path.

## Key Concepts

- **Loops**: Used to repeat actions until Reeborg reaches the goal.
- **Conditionals**: Used to check for walls and decide the next move.
- **Functions**: Encapsulated reusable logic for Reeborg's movements.

## How to Use

1. Copy the code from `reeborgs_world_maze_challenge.py`.
2. Open the [Reeborg's World website](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html).
3. Paste the code into the editor.
4. Select the "Maze" world.
5. Run the program to see Reeborg navigate the maze.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of basic programming constructs like loops and conditionals.
- Problem-solving skills by breaking down the maze navigation into smaller steps.
- Writing clean and reusable code using
