# Hangman Game (hangman_game.py)

## Description
A simple command-line Hangman implementation written in Python. The script runs an interactive game where the player guesses letters to reveal a hidden word within a limited number of wrong attempts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- No external libraries required

## Running
From the project directory run:
```
python hangman_game.py
```
The game opens in the terminal and prompts for input.

## Gameplay
- The program selects a secret word (randomly from an internal list or file).
- The player types a single letter to guess, or a full-word guess (if supported).
- Correct letters are revealed in their positions; incorrect letters reduce remaining attempts.
- The game ends when the word is fully revealed (win) or when the allowed number of wrong guesses is exhausted (loss).
- The current word state, list of wrong guesses, and remaining attempts are shown after each guess.

## Code overview
The file is organized into a few logical parts:

- Top-level constants and configuration
    - Word list or path to a words file.
    - Maximum allowed incorrect guesses.

- Helper functions
    - Word selection: pick a random secret word.
    - Display/update state: produce the masked word display (e.g., `_ a _ _ m a n`).
    - Input handling: read and validate player input (single alphabetic character or word).
    - State update: apply a guess to reveal letters or record a wrong guess.

- Main game loop
    - Initializes state, prints instructions, then loops:
        - Show current state (masked word, wrong guesses, attempts left).
        - Get and validate a guess.
        - Update state and check win/loss conditions.
    - Print final result and reveal the secret word.

## Customization
- Change the word source (expand the internal list or load from a file).
- Adjust maximum incorrect guesses to make the game easier/harder.
- Add features: hint system, score tracking, or a larger word list.

## Testing
- Play several rounds manually to verify input handling and win/loss logic.
- For unit testing, factor helper functions (word selection, mask generation, state update) into testable units and write tests for each.

## Contribution
- Open a PR with a short description of changes.
- Keep changes small, and include tests if modifying core logic.

## License
- Include a license file in the repository or add a license header to the file as needed.

If you want, I can generate a more detailed README that includes the actual function names and example input/output based on the current implementation of hangman_game.py.
