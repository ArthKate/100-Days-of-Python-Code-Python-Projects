# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game. It is part of the **100 Days of Python Code** challenge.

## How It Works

- The user selects one of the three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
- The game determines the winner based on the following rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors.
  - Scissors beats Paper.
  - Paper beats Rock.
- If both the user and the computer choose the same option, it results in a tie.

## Features

- Interactive user input.
- Randomized computer choice.
- Clear winner determination logic.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python rock_paper_scissors.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Learning Outcomes

- Practice with conditional statements.
- Use of Python's `random` module.
- Handling user input and basic program flow.

## Future Improvements

- Add a scoring system to track multiple rounds.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Allow the user to play against another player.

Enjoy the game!
